# Getting Started

You only need two things to work with the Comet SDK: an API key and a dream. To get your API key, visit [withcomet.com/devstart](https://withcomet.com/devstart).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you plan on launching an NFT collection that requires payment, you'll also need to connect Comet to your bank account so we can send you payments. To set this up, visit [withcomet.com/settings/payments](https://withcomet.com/settings/payments).\
\
No users will be able to mint your NFT until this step is completed.
