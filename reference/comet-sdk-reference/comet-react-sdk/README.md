# Comet React SDK

With Comet's React SDK, you can embed Comet's functionality – Instant Wallets, zero-transaction NFT minting with credit cards, and galleries – into your own website. It's the easiest way to get NFTs into the hands of your most loyal users.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Comet React SDK is in early stage development; APIs are subject to change significantly. This documentation is for our latest version, `v1.`
{% endhint %}

## Components

Comet provides pre-built components that let your users log in and mint NFTs without needing any extra logic. Use these components to get started quickly.

## Hooks

For a more customized or in-depth Web3 experience, we expose React hooks that provide the same functionality as our Components, plus additional features like transaction signing.
